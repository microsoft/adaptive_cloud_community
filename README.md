# Azure Adaptive Cloud Community

![Arc](./img/adaptivecloud.png)

## Overview

Once a month, the various Adaptive cloud product groups at Microsoft will hold a call to showcase new features, talk through important topics and engage in a Q&A regarding hybrid, multicloud, and edge. The foundational goals of the call are highlighted below:

- Provide the Adaptive cloud community with product updates for products and services such as Azure Arc, Azure Stack HCI, Azure IoT, AKS and much more.
- Host a short talk and/or demo on Azure Adaptive cloud technologies and products technologies
- Collect feedback from the community on issues, blockers, use cases, and questions related to Azure Adaptive cloud technologies and products

## Who is the "community"? 💬

If you are a customer, partner, Microsoft employee, or just someone who loves tech, for us, you are part of our community. The content presented in our calls is **not under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA)** and is public because our mission is just to spread the ❤️ for Azure Adaptive cloud solutions and technologies.
