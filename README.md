# Azure Adaptive Cloud Community

## Overview

Once a month, the various Adaptive Cloud product groups at Microsoft will hold a call to showcase new features, talk through important topics and engage in a Q&A regarding hybrid, multicloud, and edge. The foundational goals of the call are highlighted below:

- Provide the Adaptive Cloud community with product updates for products and services such as Azure Arc, Azure Stack HCI, Azure IoT, AKS and much more.
- Host a short talk and/or demo on Azure Adaptive Cloud technologies and products technologies
- Collect feedback from the community on issues, blockers, use cases, and questions related to Azure Adaptive Cloud technologies and products
