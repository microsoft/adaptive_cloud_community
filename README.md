# Microsoft Azure Arc Community Monthly Meetup

## Overview

Once a month, the various Azure Hybrid Cloud product groups at Microsoft will hold a call to showcase new features, talk through important topics and engage in a Q&A regarding Azure Arc. The foundational goals of the call are highlighted below:

- Provide the Azure Arc community with product updates
- Host a short talk and/or demo on Azure Hybrid Cloud technologies and products technologies
- Collect feedback from the community on issues, blockers, use cases, and questions related to Azure Hybrid Cloud technologies and products

## Who is the "community"?

If you are a customer, partner, Microsoft employee or just someone who loves tech, for us, you are part of our community. The content presented in our calls is **not under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA)** and public because our mission is just to spread the ❤️ for Azure Hybrid Cloud solutions and technologies.

Each monthly meetup will be 1 hour, don't be late, we have a lot to cover 🤓

- 2 minutes: Welcome
- 45-50 minutes: Product updates
